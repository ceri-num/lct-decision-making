# Decision-Making: Distributed & Under Uncertainty

These pages serve as support for the lecture of _Decision-Making DUU_ apparing in differents module:

- UV Model Agent Decision - **uv-mad**
- Artificial Intelligence and Combinatorial Optimization (Introcduction & Project) - **P-AICO-I**
- Introduction of RL for Health Science
- Chef de Projet IA

You will find there mostly presentation of the core notions. The tutorials are mostly based on [HackaGames](https://ktorz-net.github.io/hackagames)
